        <p>Nigerian mainstream music, fans commonly refer to the biggest three music stars Davido, Wizkid, and Burna Boy as the Big 3.
        </p>
        <br>
        <label id="sub-txt">Damini Ogulu, better known as Burna Boy, was born in Port Harcourt, Nigeria in 1991. He grew up surrounded by music, heavily influenced by Fela Kuti's iconic Afrobeat sounds. This left an indelible mark on Burna's style, laying the foundation for his own blend of Afrobeats with influences from dancehall, reggae, and hip-hop.

            In 2010, Burna moved to London to study Media and Communication at the University of Sussex. It was there that he began performing and recording music, honing his craft and building a local following.
            
            "Like to Party" and the Afrobeats explosion: In 2012, Burna's single "Like to Party" became a viral sensation, propelling him onto the international stage. This success coincided with the global rise of Afrobeats, a genre he helped popularize and shape with his infectious energy and lyrical flow.<br>While his statement of not being part of the big 3 might come as boastful, Burna Boy has indeed distinguished himself and he has the accolades to back up his claim.
            Come February 5, 2024, Burna Boy will be hoping to add to his Grammy award as he's nominated in four categories for the 2024 Grammy Awards. His four nominations are a Nigerian record which takes his total career nominations to 10 which is also a Nigerian record.
